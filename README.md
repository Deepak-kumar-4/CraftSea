## 🧩 Project Overview

CraftSea is an online craft store offering a wide range of handmade crafting supplies. Customers can browse products, manage a cart and wishlist, check out, and track orders — while a separate admin panel handles inventory, order fulfillment, and sales reporting.

The project is split into two independent applications sharing the same database:

- **`User/`** — the customer-facing storefront
- **`admin/`** — the back-office management panel

---

## 💡 Motivation

CraftSea was developed to simulate a complete e-commerce ecosystem for handmade crafts. The goal was to gain practical experience in designing customer-facing shopping workflows, secure authentication, database-driven applications, and an administrative management system within a full-stack architecture.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Category     | Technology                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **Backend**  | PHP (procedural, mysqli)              |
| **Database** | MySQL / MariaDB                       |
| **Frontend** | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap    |
| **Server**   | Apache (XAMPP)                        |
| **Auth**     | PHP Sessions, bcrypt password hashing |

---

## 🏛️ System Components

The application is divided into two independent modules that share a common database:

- **Customer Module** – Product browsing, authentication, cart, wishlist, checkout, and order management.
- **Admin Module** – Product management, order processing, customer management, and sales reporting.
- **Database Layer** – Centralized MySQL database storing products, customers, orders, and newsletters.
- **Authentication Layer** – Session-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing and secure credential management.

---

## 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained practical experience in:

- Building complete full-stack web applications
- Designing relational databases
- Implementing secure authentication and authorization
- Preventing SQL Injection and XSS attacks
- Developing administrative dashboards
- Managing customer and order workflows

---

## 🔐 Security & Best Practices

This codebase went through a dedicated security audit and hardening pass:

- **SQL Injection** — every query built from `$_GET`/`$_POST` input was rewritten using `mysqli` prepared statements (`prepare` / `bind_param` / `execute`), closing injection points across both the storefront and admin panel.
- **Password Security** — customer passwords are hashed with `password_hash()` (bcrypt) and verified with `password_verify()`. Previously stored as plaintext integers — now `varchar(255)` bcrypt hashes.
- **XSS Prevention** — all user-input and database-fetched values are escaped at the point of output: `htmlspecialchars()` for HTML context, `json_encode()` for values embedded in inline `<script>` blocks or JS attributes (a distinction often missed, since HTML-escaping alone doesn't protect JS string contexts).
- **Admin Authentication** — credentials moved from hardcoded values to environment variables (`ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD`), with safe fallback defaults for local development only.
- **Data Hygiene** — the committed database seed data was scrubbed of real-looking personal information (names, emails, phone numbers, addresses), replaced with clearly fake demo accounts.

---

## 📈 Design Considerations

- Modular separation between customer and admin modules
- Database normalization for product and order management
- Prepared statements for secure database operations
- Environment-based configuration for sensitive credentials
- Bootstrap-based responsive UI for cross-device compatibility

### Database Schema

The schema as actually implemented (see `craftsea.sql`):

| Table         | Key Columns                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `customer`    | `customer_id` (PK), `password` (bcrypt hash), `name`, `address`, `phone_no`, `email`, `dob`                         |
| `product`     | `product_id` (PK), `name`, `description`, `specification`, `brand`, `price`, `category`, `build_type`, `image1/2/3` |
| `cart`        | `product_id`, `customer_id`, `image`, `name`, `price`, `quantity`                                                   |
| `wishlist`    | `product_id`, `customer_id`, `name`, `price`, `image`                                                               |
| `orders`      | `order_id` (PK), `customer_id`, product/shipping snapshot fields, `status`, `reason`                                |
| `contactus`   | `name`, `email`, `subject`, `message`                                                                               |
| `newsletters` | `email`, `customer_id`, `name`                                                                                      |

Admin authentication is environment-variable based (`ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD`), not backed by a database table.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) (Apache + MySQL/MariaDB + PHP)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository into your XAMPP `htdocs` folder:**

```bash
cd C:\xampp\htdocs
git clone https://github.com/Deepak-kumar-4/CraftSea.git
```

2. **Start Apache and MySQL** via the XAMPP Control Panel.

3. **Import the database** — open phpMyAdmin, create a database named `Craftsea`, and import `craftsea.sql`.

4. **(Optional) Configure admin credentials** — copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Note: this project has no dotenv loader, so these must be set as real environment variables (e.g. via Apache's `SetEnv` config) to take effect — otherwise the app falls back to local-dev defaults.

5. **Visit the site:**
   - Storefront: `http://localhost/CraftSea/User/index.php`
   - Admin panel: `http://localhost/CraftSea/admin/loginadmin.php`

### Demo Account

A demo customer account is seeded in the database for testing:

- **Email:** `test@example.com`
- **Password:** `Test1234!`

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

- Payment Gateway Integration
- Real-Time Notifications
- Inventory Management
- REST API Support
- Docker Deployment
